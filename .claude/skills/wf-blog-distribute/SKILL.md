# Blog → Distribute

End-to-end workflow: draft a blog post, clean it up, optimize for search, then push it across social and email channels.

## Stage 1: Draft the Blog Post

Load and run the `blog` skill for the full drafting workflow (brief intake, outline, draft, approval).

**Gate:** Do not proceed until the user approves the final draft.

## Stage 2: Quality Pass

Load and run the `tagore` skill on the approved draft. Fix any AI patterns, scoring issues, or voice problems it flags.

**Gate:** Show the user the Tagore score and any remaining items. Get approval before proceeding.

## Stage 3: SEO Optimization

Load and run the `seo-geo` skill to optimize the post:
- Page title, meta description, slug
- Heading structure and keyword placement
- Internal linking opportunities
- AI engine optimization (GEO)

**Gate:** Show the user the SEO recommendations. Apply approved changes.

## Stage 4: Social Distribution

Load and run the `social-content` skill. Using the approved blog post as source material, generate:
- 1-2 LinkedIn posts (different angles)
- 1-2 Twitter/X posts
- Any other platforms the user specifies

Pass forward: the blog title, key takeaways, target audience, and any compelling quotes or stats from the post.

**Gate:** User approves or edits the social posts.

## Stage 5: Email Integration (Optional)

Ask: "Want to add this to an email sequence or send a standalone email about it?"

If yes, load and run the `email-sequence` skill to:
- Draft a newsletter mention or standalone email
- Suggest where in an existing nurture sequence this content fits

If no, skip to the summary.

## Summary

Present a checklist of everything produced:

```
## Blog → Distribute Complete

### Blog Post
- [title] — [path to file]

### SEO
- Title tag: [title]
- Meta description: [description]
- Target keyword: [keyword]

### Social Posts
- LinkedIn: [count] posts → [paths]
- Twitter/X: [count] posts → [paths]

### Email
- [what was created, or "Skipped"]

### Next Steps
- [ ] Publish the blog post
- [ ] Schedule social posts
- [ ] Queue email
```

## Output Structure

All files go into a single project folder:

```
marketing/blog/[post-slug]/
  blog-post.md
  social-linkedin-1.md
  social-linkedin-2.md
  social-twitter-1.md
  email-announcement.md        (if email stage run)
  email-nurture-insert.md      (if email stage run)
  seo-metadata.md
```

Derive `[post-slug]` from the blog title. Confirm with the user before creating files.

## Rules

- Each stage uses the full component skill, not a shortcut version
- Always gate between stages — never auto-advance without user approval
- Carry context forward: audience, key messages, tone, and stats flow from stage to stage
- If the user wants to skip a stage, skip it cleanly
- All output goes into the project folder, not scattered across `marketing/`
