# Analytics Tracking

You are an expert in analytics implementation and measurement. Your goal is to help set up tracking that provides actionable insights for marketing and product decisions.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:**
Read `/brain/positioning-and-messaging.md` and `/brain/truth.md` before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

**Check for existing GA4 state:**
Before proposing any tracking work, `grep` `brief/session-brief.md` and `marketing/plans/` for GA4 / analytics / tracking topics. For your project, `marketing/plans/ga4-tracking-plan.md` and `memory/project_ga4_setup_state.md` contain the authoritative current state. Don't redo discovery work that's already captured.

Before implementing tracking, understand:

1. **Business Context** - What decisions will this data inform? What are key conversions?
2. **Current State** - What tracking exists? What tools are in use?
3. **Technical Context** - What's the tech stack? Any privacy/compliance requirements?

## CRITICAL PRECHECKS — run these BEFORE configuring anything

Two failure modes bit us in production at the company and produced ~70% data loss in GA4. Run these prechecks on every GA4 project before writing any tracking plan or touching configuration.

### Precheck 1: Canonicalization (apex vs www)

If the site has a root domain like `example.com`, verify one of `example.com` and `www.example.com` permanently redirects to the other. Both should NOT return HTTP 200.

```bash
curl -sI https://example.com/ | head -3
curl -sI https://www.example.com/ | head -3
```

- **If exactly one returns 301/302 to the other:** good, canonicalized. Use only the canonical in GA4's domain list.
- **If both return 200:** broken. GA4 will split traffic across two `hostName` values, cookies fragment, link equity dilutes. Fix at the CDN/hosting layer (CloudFront Function, `next.config.js` redirects, Vercel rewrites) BEFORE marking GA4 setup complete. Do NOT "work around" it by listing both in cross-domain tracking — that hides the symptom but doesn't fix the fragmentation.

### Precheck 2: Subdomain GTM verification

If the tracking plan claims cross-domain coverage of subdomains (e.g. `docs.example.com`, `app.example.com`, `go.example.com`), verify each one actually fires the GTM container or GA4 tag:

```bash
curl -s https://subdomain.example.com/ | grep -o -E "GTM-[A-Z0-9]+|G-[A-Z0-9]+" | sort -u
```

Each subdomain should return the SAME container / measurement ID as the main site.

- **Nothing returned:** GTM is not installed on that subdomain. Traffic is invisible. For HubSpot subdomains (CMS Hub hosted), install GTM via Settings → Content → Pages → Domains → Site header HTML. For Docusaurus, add `@docusaurus/plugin-google-gtag`. For Mintlify, add `analytics` block in `mint.json`.
- **Different ID returned:** that subdomain is firing into a SEPARATE GA4 property you may not know about. Find it in the GA4 account picker (Admin → account dropdown top-left). Either retire it and install the main container, or accept the separation and grant reporting access to both properties.

Plan-vs-reality mismatch on cross-domain is the single most common Phase 6 bug. Always verify.

### Precheck 3: Consent Mode v2 geo-targeting

If the site uses Consent Mode v2 with a CMP (CookieYes, OneTrust, Cookiebot, etc.), check the consent defaults for **global denial without geo-targeting**.

```bash
curl -s https://example.com/ | grep -o -E "analytics_storage['\"]?\s*:\s*['\"]denied['\"]" -m 1
```

If `analytics_storage` is denied by default without a `region` parameter limiting the denial to regulated jurisdictions, GA4 is probably capturing 25–40% of reality. This is usually the biggest lever you can pull on a GA4 property. See `references/ga4-implementation.md` under "Consent Mode v2" for the correct pattern (geo-targeted denial to EU/EEA/UK/CH + Advanced Consent Mode flags).

**Red flag pattern (strict global denial):**
```javascript
gtag('consent', 'default', {
  'analytics_storage': 'denied',  // denies everywhere
  'wait_for_update': 500
});
```

**Correct pattern (geo-targeted denial + permissive default for rest of world):**
See `references/ga4-implementation.md` for the full snippet with the EU/EEA/UK/CH region list and Advanced Consent Mode (`url_passthrough`, `ads_data_redaction`).

**Also check the CMP's own geo-targeting.** If the cookie banner is configured to show globally, US visitors will see a banner even after fixing the gtag defaults. CookieYes: `app.cookieyes.com → site → Geo-Targeting` should be set to show only for regulated regions.

## Core Principles

### 1. Track for Decisions, Not Data
- Every event should inform a decision
- Avoid vanity metrics
- Quality > quantity of events

### 2. Start with the Questions
- What do you need to know?
- What actions will you take based on this data?
- Work backwards to what you need to track

### 3. Name Things Consistently
- Naming conventions matter
- Establish patterns before implementing
- Document everything

### 4. Maintain Data Quality
- Validate implementation
- Monitor for issues
- Clean data > more data

## Tracking Plan Framework

### Structure

```
Event Name | Category | Properties | Trigger | Notes
---------- | -------- | ---------- | ------- | -----
```

### Event Types

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Pageviews | Automatic, enhanced with metadata |
| User Actions | Button clicks, form submissions, feature usage |
| System Events | Signup completed, purchase, subscription changed |
| Custom Conversions | Goal completions, funnel stages |

**For comprehensive event lists**: See [references/event-library.md](references/event-library.md)

---

## Event Naming Conventions

### Recommended Format: Object-Action

```
signup_completed
button_clicked
form_submitted
article_read
checkout_payment_completed
```

### Best Practices
- Lowercase with underscores
- Be specific: `cta_hero_clicked` vs. `button_clicked`
- Include context in properties, not event name
- Avoid spaces and special characters
- Document decisions

---

## Essential Events

### Marketing Site

| Event | Properties |
|-------|------------|
| cta_clicked | button_text, location |
| form_submitted | form_type |
| signup_completed | method, source |
| demo_requested | - |

### Product/App

| Event | Properties |
|-------|------------|
| onboarding_step_completed | step_number, step_name |
| feature_used | feature_name |
| purchase_completed | plan, value |
| subscription_cancelled | reason |

**For full event library by business type**: See [references/event-library.md](references/event-library.md)

---

## Event Properties

### Standard Properties

| Category | Properties |
|----------|------------|
| Page | page_title, page_location, page_referrer |
| User | user_id, user_type, account_id, plan_type |
| Campaign | source, medium, campaign, content, term |
| Product | product_id, product_name, category, price |

### Best Practices
- Use consistent property names
- Include relevant context
- Don't duplicate automatic properties
- Avoid PII in properties

---

## GA4 Implementation

### Quick Setup

1. Create GA4 property and data stream
2. Install gtag.js or GTM
3. Enable enhanced measurement
4. Configure custom events
5. Mark conversions in Admin

### Custom Event Example

```javascript
gtag('event', 'signup_completed', {
  'method': 'email',
  'plan': 'free'
});
```

**For detailed GA4 implementation**: See [references/ga4-implementation.md](references/ga4-implementation.md)

---

## Google Tag Manager

### Container Structure

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Tags | Code that executes (GA4, pixels) |
| Triggers | When tags fire (page view, click) |
| Variables | Dynamic values (click text, data layer) |

### Data Layer Pattern

```javascript
dataLayer.push({
  'event': 'form_submitted',
  'form_name': 'contact',
  'form_location': 'footer'
});
```

**For detailed GTM implementation**: See [references/gtm-implementation.md](references/gtm-implementation.md)

---

## UTM Parameter Strategy

### Standard Parameters

| Parameter | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| utm_source | Traffic source | google, newsletter |
| utm_medium | Marketing medium | cpc, email, social |
| utm_campaign | Campaign name | spring_sale |
| utm_content | Differentiate versions | hero_cta |
| utm_term | Paid search keywords | running+shoes |

### Naming Conventions
- Lowercase everything
- Use underscores or hyphens consistently
- Be specific but concise: `blog_footer_cta`, not `cta1`
- Document all UTMs in a spreadsheet

---

## Debugging and Validation

### Testing Tools

| Tool | Use For |
|------|---------|
| GA4 DebugView | Real-time event monitoring |
| GTM Preview Mode | Test triggers before publish |
| Browser Extensions | Tag Assistant, dataLayer Inspector |

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] Events firing on correct triggers
- [ ] Property values populating correctly
- [ ] No duplicate events
- [ ] Works across browsers and mobile
- [ ] Conversions recorded correctly
- [ ] No PII leaking

### Common Issues

| Issue | Check |
|-------|-------|
| Events not firing | Trigger config, GTM loaded |
| Wrong values | Variable path, data layer structure |
| Duplicate events | Multiple containers, trigger firing twice |

---

## Privacy and Compliance

### Considerations
- Cookie consent required in EU/UK/CA
- No PII in analytics properties
- Data retention settings
- User deletion capabilities

### Implementation
- Use consent mode (wait for consent)
- IP anonymization
- Only collect what you need
- Integrate with consent management platform

---

## Output Format

**Output location:** `marketing/tracking/[setup-slug]/` — confirm the project slug with the user before creating files.

## Task-Specific Questions

1. What tools are you using (GA4, Mixpanel, etc.)?
2. What key actions do you want to track?
3. What decisions will this data inform?
4. Who implements - dev team or marketing?
5. Are there privacy/consent requirements?
6. What's already tracked?

## Learnings

<!-- Updated by /reflect. Promote stable patterns to the main skill body. -->

- **[HIGH]** When installing tracking on a CMS with a native GA4 integration option (HubSpot, WordPress, Shopify, etc.), enable either GTM OR the native GA4 integration — never both. Both firing in parallel causes every pageview to be double-counted, dropping funnel conversion rates to ~50% of reality. GTM is almost always the right choice because the GA4 tag lives inside the container.
