## Output Structure

```
marketing/campaigns/[campaign-slug]/
  strategy.md
  core-messaging.md
  landing-page-copy.md          (if landing page needed)
  email-sequence.md
  social-linkedin.md
  social-twitter.md

Derive `[campaign-slug]` from the campaign name. Confirm with the user before creating files.

## Rules

- Each stage uses the full component skill
- Always gate between stages
- Campaign messaging must stay consistent across all channels
- Carry audience segments, key messages, and timeline through every stage
- If the user wants to skip a channel, skip it
- All output goes into the project folder, not scattered across `marketing/`
