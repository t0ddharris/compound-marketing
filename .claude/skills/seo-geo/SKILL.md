# SEO/GEO: Search & Generative Engine Optimization

You are an expert in both traditional search engine optimization (SEO) and generative engine optimization (GEO). Your job is to help content rank in Google/Bing AND get cited by AI engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Copilot, and Claude.

**Pair with `web-design` when recommendations touch on-page markup.** Technical SEO and on-page work often reshape semantic HTML, heading hierarchy, landmarks, and accessibility primitives. `web-design/references/accessibility.md` and `web-design/references/component-composition.md` own the brand-specific patterns for those. Load `web-design` when your recommendation involves HTML structure changes; stay in this skill for pure meta/content/keyword/citation work.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:**
Read `/brain/positioning-and-messaging.md` and `/brain/truth.md` before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Before starting any work, understand:

1. **Site Context**
   - What type of site? (SaaS, e-commerce, blog, etc.)
   - What's the primary business goal?
   - What keywords/topics are priorities?

2. **Current State**
   - Any known issues or concerns?
   - Current organic traffic level?
   - Recent changes or migrations?

3. **Scope**
   - Full site audit, specific pages, or content optimization?
   - SEO focus, GEO focus, or both?
   - Access to Search Console / analytics?

---

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Site Audit

#### Crawlability & Indexation

**Robots.txt**
- Check for unintentional blocks
- Verify important pages allowed
- Check sitemap reference
- Confirm AI bot access: Googlebot, Bingbot, PerplexityBot, ChatGPT-User, ClaudeBot, GPTBot

**XML Sitemap**
- Exists and accessible
- Submitted to Search Console
- Contains only canonical, indexable URLs
- Updated regularly
- Proper formatting

**Site Architecture**
- Important pages within 3 clicks of homepage
- Logical hierarchy
- Internal linking structure
- No orphan pages

**Crawl Budget Issues** (for large sites)
- Parameterized URLs under control
- Faceted navigation handled properly
- Infinite scroll with pagination fallback
- Session IDs not in URLs

#### Index Status

- site:domain.com check
- Search Console coverage report
- Compare indexed vs. expected

**Indexation Issues**
- Noindex tags on important pages
- Canonicals pointing wrong direction
- Redirect chains/loops
- Soft 404s
- Duplicate content without canonicals

**Canonicalization**
- All pages have canonical tags
- Self-referencing canonicals on unique pages
- HTTP to HTTPS canonicals
- www vs. non-www consistency
- Trailing slash consistency

#### Core Web Vitals & Speed

- LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): < 2.5s
- INP (Interaction to Next Paint): < 200ms
- CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): < 0.1

**Speed Factors**
- Server response time (TTFB)
- Image optimization
- JavaScript execution
- CSS delivery
- Caching headers
- CDN usage
- Font loading

#### Mobile-Friendliness

- Responsive design (not separate m. site)
- Tap target sizes
- Viewport configured
- No horizontal scroll
- Same content as desktop
- Mobile-first indexing readiness

#### Security & HTTPS

- HTTPS across entire site
- Valid SSL certificate
- No mixed content
- HTTP to HTTPS redirects
- HSTS header

#### URL Structure

- Readable, descriptive URLs
- Keywords in URLs where natural
- Consistent structure
- No unnecessary parameters
- Lowercase and hyphen-separated
- No dates in URLs (they age content)

---

### Step 2: Keyword Research

1. **Start with ICP pain points** -- Pull pain points and use cases from `/brain/positioning-and-messaging.md` and `/brain/use-cases.md`. Keywords should map to real problems the target audience searches for
2. **Intent mapping** -- Classify every keyword by search intent:
   - **Informational**: "what is AI agent security" -- target with blog posts and guides
   - **Navigational**: "[Company] docs" -- ensure owned pages rank
   - **Commercial investigation**: "best AI security tools for enterprises" -- target with comparison content
   - **Transactional**: "[Company] pricing" -- ensure product pages rank
3. **Difficulty and volume analysis** -- Prioritize keywords with reasonable search volume where [Company] can realistically compete. Avoid vanity keywords with extreme competition
4. **Long-tail opportunities** -- Identify specific, lower-competition phrases (e.g., "AI agent attack detection enterprise") that map directly to the company capabilities in `truth.md`
5. **Keyword clusters** -- Group related keywords into topic clusters. Each cluster should have a pillar page and supporting content
6. **International keyword conflict identification** -- Flag keywords with different meanings across regions

---

### Step 3: On-Page SEO Optimization

#### Title Tags
- Unique titles for each page
- Primary keyword near beginning
- 50-60 characters (visible in SERP)
- Compelling and click-worthy
- Brand name placement (end, usually)

**Common issues:** Duplicate titles, too long (truncated), too short (wasted opportunity), keyword stuffing, missing entirely

#### Meta Descriptions
- Unique descriptions per page
- 150-160 characters
- Includes primary keyword
- Clear value proposition
- Call to action

#### Heading Structure
- One H1 per page, includes primary keyword
- H2s: Major sections, include secondary/related keywords where natural
- H3s: Subsections, use for scannability
- Never skip heading levels (H1 to H3 without H2)

#### Content Body
- Primary keyword in the first 100 words
- Related keywords distributed naturally throughout
- Minimum content length: 800 words for blog posts, 300 for product pages
- Internal links to related content (3-5 per post)
- External links to authoritative sources where appropriate

#### Image Optimization
- Descriptive file names (not `IMG_1234.png`)
- Alt text on all images
- Alt text describes image, includes keywords when relevant
- Compressed file sizes
- Modern formats (WebP)
- Lazy loading implemented
- Responsive images

#### Internal Linking
- Important pages well-linked
- Descriptive anchor text
- Logical link relationships
- No broken internal links
- Reasonable link count per page

#### Keyword Targeting (Per Page)
- Clear primary keyword target
- Title, H1, URL aligned
- Content satisfies search intent
- Not competing with other pages (cannibalization)

#### Keyword Targeting (Site-Wide)
- Keyword mapping document
- No major gaps in coverage
- No keyword cannibalization
- Logical topical clusters

#### Open Graph & Social Meta

```html
<title>{Primary Keyword} - {Brand} | {Secondary Keyword}</title>
<meta name="description" content="{Compelling description with keyword, 150-160 chars}">

<!-- Open Graph -->
<meta property="og:title" content="{Title}">
<meta property="og:description" content="{Description}">
<meta property="og:image" content="{Image URL 1200x630}">
<meta property="og:url" content="{Canonical URL}">
<meta property="og:type" content="website">

<!-- Twitter Cards -->
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image">
<meta name="twitter:title" content="{Title}">
<meta name="twitter:description" content="{Description}">
<meta name="twitter:image" content="{Image URL}">
```

---

### Step 4: GEO -- Generative Engine Optimization

GEO is the practice of optimizing content to be cited by AI search engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Copilot, Claude) rather than only ranked by traditional algorithms.

#### The 9 Princeton GEO Methods

Research from Princeton quantified the impact of different optimization techniques on AI citation visibility:

| Method | Visibility Boost | How to Apply |
|--------|------------------|--------------|
| Cite Sources | +40% | Add authoritative citations and references |
| Statistics Addition | +37% | Include specific numbers, data points, and timeframes |
| Quotation Addition | +30% | Add expert quotes with named attribution |
| Authoritative Tone | +25% | Use confident, expert language |
| Easy-to-Understand | +20% | Simplify complex concepts for broader audiences |
| Technical Terms | +18% | Include domain-specific terminology |
| Unique Words | +15% | Increase vocabulary diversity |
| Fluency Optimization | +15-30% | Improve readability and flow |
| Keyword Stuffing | -10% | AVOID -- hurts visibility in both SEO and GEO |

**Best combination:** Fluency + Statistics = maximum boost.

#### GEO Content Structure Rules

1. **Answer-first format** -- Put the direct answer at the top. AI engines extract the first clear answer they find
2. **Clear heading hierarchy** -- H1 > H2 > H3, with each heading describing what follows
3. **Bullet points and numbered lists** -- AI engines parse structured content more reliably
4. **Tables for comparison data** -- Easier for AI to extract and cite than prose
5. **Short paragraphs** -- 2-3 sentences maximum. Dense blocks get skipped
6. **Self-contained answer blocks** -- Each section should make sense if extracted alone

#### GEO Content Patterns

**Statistic Citation Block** (Statistics increase AI citation rates by 15-30%)
```
[Claim statement]. According to [Source/Organization], [specific statistic with number and timeframe]. [Context for why this matters].
```

**Expert Quote Block**
```
"[Direct quote from expert]," says [Expert Name], [Title/Role] at [Organization]. [1 sentence of context].
```

**Authoritative Claim Block**
```
[Topic] [verb: is/has/requires] [clear, specific claim]. [Source] [confirms/reports/found] that [supporting evidence]. This [explains/means/suggests] [implication or action].
```

**Self-Contained Answer Block**
```
**[Topic/Question]**: [Complete, self-contained answer that makes sense without additional context. Include specific details, numbers, or examples in 2-3 sentences.]
```

**Evidence Sandwich Block**
```
[Opening claim statement].

Evidence supporting this includes:
- [Data point 1 with source]
- [Data point 2 with source]
- [Data point 3 with source]

[Concluding statement connecting evidence to actionable insight].
```

#### FAQPage Schema for GEO

FAQ schema earns higher citation rates across AI engines. Use for any page with question-answer content:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [{
    "@type": "Question",
    "name": "What is [topic]?",
    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "According to [source], [answer with statistics]."
    }
  }]
}
```

---

### Step 5: Platform-Specific AI Optimization

Each AI engine has different citation behaviors. Optimize for the ones that matter most to your audience.

#### ChatGPT
- Branded domain authority matters: cited 11% more than third-party sources
- Content freshness: pages updated within 30 days get 3.2x more citations
- Backlink strength: domains with >350K referring domains average 8.4 citations
- Match content style to ChatGPT's response format (clear, structured, direct)

#### Perplexity
- Allow PerplexityBot in robots.txt
- FAQ Schema earns higher citation rates
- PDF documents are prioritized for citation
- Semantic relevance matters more than keyword density

#### Google AI Overview (SGE)
- E-E-A-T signals are critical (Experience, Expertise, Authority, Trust)
- Structured data (schema markup) strongly preferred
- Topical authority through content clusters + internal linking
- Authoritative citations boost visibility by up to 132%

#### Microsoft Copilot / Bing
- Bing indexing is required for citation (separate from Google)
- Microsoft ecosystem signals help (LinkedIn, GitHub mentions)
- Page speed < 2 seconds
- Clear entity definitions

#### Claude
- Brave Search indexing (Claude uses Brave, not Google)
- High factual density: data-rich content preferred
- Structural clarity: easy-to-extract formatting

#### Robots.txt for AI Bot Access

Ensure your robots.txt allows all major AI crawlers:

```
User-agent: Googlebot
Allow: /

User-agent: Bingbot
Allow: /

User-agent: PerplexityBot
Allow: /

User-agent: ChatGPT-User
Allow: /

User-agent: GPTBot
Allow: /

User-agent: ClaudeBot
Allow: /
```

---

### Step 5b: AI Visibility Audit

Before optimizing for AI citation, assess your current AI search presence.

#### Check AI Answers for Key Queries

Test 10-20 of your most important queries across platforms:

| Query | Google AI Overview | ChatGPT | Perplexity | You Cited? | Competitors Cited? |
|-------|:-----------------:|:-------:|:----------:|:----------:|:-----------------:|
| [query 1] | Yes/No | Yes/No | Yes/No | Yes/No | [who] |

**Query types to test:**
- "What is [your product category]?"
- "Best [product category] for [use case]"
- "[Your brand] vs [competitor]"
- "How to [problem your product solves]"
- "[Your product category] pricing"

#### Analyze Citation Patterns

When competitors get cited and you don't, examine:
- **Content structure** — Is their content more extractable?
- **Authority signals** — Do they have more citations, stats, expert quotes?
- **Freshness** — Is their content more recently updated?
- **Schema markup** — Do they have structured data you're missing?
- **Third-party presence** — Are they cited via Wikipedia, Reddit, review sites?

#### Content Extractability Check

For each priority page, verify:

| Check | Pass/Fail |
|-------|-----------|
| Clear definition in first paragraph? | |
| Self-contained answer blocks (work without surrounding context)? | |
| Statistics with sources cited? | |
| Comparison tables for "[X] vs [Y]" queries? | |
| FAQ section with natural-language questions? | |
| Schema markup (FAQ, HowTo, Article, Product)? | |
| Expert attribution (author name, credentials)? | |
| Recently updated (within 6 months)? | |
| Heading structure matches query patterns? | |
| AI bots allowed in robots.txt? | |

---

### Step 5c: Content Types That Get Cited Most

Not all content is equally citable. Prioritize these formats:

| Content Type | Citation Share | Why AI Cites It |
|-------------|:------------:|----------------|
| **Comparison articles** | ~33% | Structured, balanced, high-intent |
| **Definitive guides** | ~15% | Comprehensive, authoritative |
| **Original research/data** | ~12% | Unique, citable statistics |
| **Best-of/listicles** | ~10% | Clear structure, entity-rich |
| **Product pages** | ~10% | Specific details AI can extract |
| **How-to guides** | ~8% | Step-by-step structure |
| **Opinion/analysis** | ~10% | Expert perspective, quotable |

**Underperformers for AI citation:**
- Generic blog posts without structure
- Thin product pages with marketing fluff
- Gated content (AI can't access it)
- Content without dates or author attribution
- PDF-only content (harder for AI to parse)

---

### Step 5d: Third-Party Presence for AI Citation

AI systems don't just cite your website — they cite where you appear. Third-party sources can matter more than your own site.

**Key third-party citation sources:**
- **Wikipedia** (7.8% of all ChatGPT citations) — Ensure your page is accurate and current
- **Reddit** (1.8% of ChatGPT citations) — Participate authentically in relevant communities
- **Industry publications** — Get featured in roundups and comparison articles
- **Review sites** (G2, Capterra, TrustRadius for B2B SaaS) — Maintain updated profiles
- **YouTube** (frequently cited by Google AI Overviews) — Create content for key how-to queries
- **Quora** — Answer relevant questions with depth

**Key stat:** Brands are 6.5x more likely to be cited via third-party sources than their own domains.

---

### Step 5e: Monitoring AI Visibility

#### AI Visibility Monitoring Tools

| Tool | Coverage | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Otterly AI** | ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews | Share of AI voice tracking |
| **Peec AI** | ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, Copilot+ | Multi-platform monitoring at scale |
| **ZipTie** | Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity | Brand mention + sentiment tracking |
| **LLMrefs** | ChatGPT, Perplexity, AI Overviews, Gemini | SEO keyword to AI visibility mapping |

#### DIY Monitoring (No Tools)

Monthly manual check:
1. Pick your top 20 queries
2. Run each through ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google
3. Record: Are you cited? Who is? What page?
4. Log in a spreadsheet, track month-over-month

**Key stats:**
- AI Overviews appear in ~45% of Google searches
- AI Overviews reduce clicks to websites by up to 58%
- Optimized content gets cited 3x more often than non-optimized

---

### Step 5f: GEO Content Audit (file-based)

Score a finished content file (a blog post, case study, comparison page, or landing
page already in the repo) for AI-citation readiness, then apply fixes directly to the
file. This mode is **fully self-contained** — it reads a Markdown or HTML artifact and
needs no live site, Search Console, or analytics access. Use it to grade and improve
content the harness just produced.

The flow:

1. Identify the target file and its **content type** — the type drives which criteria apply.
2. Score it against the rubric, marking inapplicable criteria N/A and excluding them
   from the denominator (a narrative case study is not penalized for lacking an FAQ block).
3. Produce a **GEO readiness score (0-100)** with a prioritized, file-level fix list.
4. Offer to apply the fixes (pulling all facts from `/brain/`), re-score, and commit.

The score is a **rubric-based readiness heuristic, not a measured citation rate** — the
weights derive from the 9 Princeton methods above, which are visibility boosts, not
values that sum to 100. Never present the number as an empirical prediction.

### Step 6: Content Quality & E-E-A-T

#### Experience
- First-hand experience demonstrated
- Original insights/data
- Real examples and case studies

#### Expertise
- Author credentials visible
- Accurate, detailed information
- Properly sourced claims

- Transparent about business
- Contact information available
- Privacy policy, terms
- Secure site (HTTPS)

#### Content Depth
- Comprehensive coverage of topic
- Answers follow-up questions
- Better than top-ranking competitors
- Updated and current

---

### Step 7: Content Gap Analysis

1. **Map existing content** -- Inventory all published content and the keywords they target
2. **Identify gaps** -- Compare against keyword clusters. Which clusters have no content?
3. **Competitor content audit** -- What topics do competitors rank for that the company doesn't cover?
4. **Prioritize by opportunity** -- Rank gaps by: search volume, keyword difficulty, relevance to ICP, and alignment with messaging in `/brain/positioning-and-messaging.md`
5. **Recommend content briefs** -- For each priority gap, suggest: target keyword, suggested title, content type (blog, guide, comparison), and key points to cover

---

### Step 8: Validate & Monitor

**Schema Validation**
- Google Rich Results Test: `https://search.google.com/test/rich-results`
- Schema.org Validator: `https://validator.schema.org/`

**Check Indexing**
- Google: `site:domain.com` on Google
- Bing: `site:domain.com` on Bing
- Brave: `site:domain.com` on Brave (for Claude citation)

---

## Common Issues by Site Type

### SaaS/Product Sites
- Product pages lack content depth
- Blog not integrated with product pages
- Missing comparison/alternative pages
- Feature pages thin on content
- No glossary/educational content
- AI bots blocked in robots.txt

### Content/Blog Sites
- Outdated content not refreshed
- Keyword cannibalization
- No topical clustering
- Poor internal linking
- Missing author pages
- No structured data for AI extraction

## MCP Tools: agent-browser

### Technical SEO Auditing with agent-browser

When auditing a live site, use agent-browser for hands-on technical validation:

1. **Navigate to the page** — Run `agent-browser open <url>` to open the target URL.
2. **Check rendered HTML** — Run `agent-browser eval "document.querySelector('title')?.textContent"` to extract meta tags, canonical URLs, heading structure, schema markup, and Open Graph tags from the live DOM.
3. **Accessibility snapshot** — Run `agent-browser snapshot -i` to get the heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3), link structure, image alt text, and ARIA labels. This reveals on-page SEO structure issues at a glance.
4. **Test mobile-friendliness** — Run `agent-browser set viewport 375 812` to switch to mobile viewport, then `agent-browser screenshot` to capture. Check for horizontal scroll, tap target sizes, content visibility.
5. **Check page speed signals** — Run `agent-browser network requests` to audit resource loading: total requests, large images, render-blocking scripts, slow third-party resources.
6. **Console errors** — Run `agent-browser console` to catch JavaScript errors that might block indexing or break page functionality.
7. **Test internal links** — Run `agent-browser click` to follow key internal links and verify they resolve correctly (no 404s, no redirect chains).
8. **Full-page screenshot** — Run `agent-browser screenshot --full` to capture the entire page for visual audit.

**When to use:** Whenever auditing a live site for SEO/GEO issues. agent-browser gives real browser data — rendered DOM, actual network performance, and real mobile behavior — which is more accurate than static analysis.

## Learnings

<!-- Updated by /reflect. Promote stable patterns to the main skill body. -->

- **[HIGH]** Before recommending SEO/GEO tooling, verify current SKUs on vendor pricing pages. Vendors launched new bundled products (Semrush One, Ahrefs Brand Radar) that don't match older Pro/Guru/Business tier structures. Use agent-browser for JS-rendered pricing pages — WebFetch often returns only the JS shell.
- **[MEDIUM]** When recommending a paid tool tier, default to the lowest tier that meets current-stage capacity (keywords tracked, projects, AI prompts). Flag one critical unverified spec for sales confirmation rather than over-buying headroom. Upgrade paths exist; unused capacity doesn't.
- **[MEDIUM]** When the target has no live web property (pre-launch, demo/fictional company, or no Search Console/GA4 access), route to the file-based GEO content audit (Step 5f) instead of crawl-, SERP-, or Search-Console-dependent steps; the file-based audit is fully self-contained.
