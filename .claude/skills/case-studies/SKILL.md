# Case Study Creation

Create compelling customer success stories that demonstrate the company's value in detecting and stopping AI agent attacks targeting infrastructure.

## Source of Truth

Before writing any case study, consult the brain files:

- **Product facts:** `/brain/truth.md` — All claims must originate here
- **Messaging:** `/brain/positioning-and-messaging.md` (Section 2) — Use approved external messaging
- **ICP:** `/brain/positioning-and-messaging.md` (ICP section) — Ensure customer matches target profile
- **Value props:** `/brain/positioning-and-messaging.md` — Pull key differentiators from here
- **Audience language:** `/brain/audience-language.md` — Use the customer's vocabulary, not vendor-speak
- **Journey intelligence:** `/brain/customer-journey.md` — Understand objections, stall points, and what accelerates deals
- **Voice:** `/brain/voice-and-tone.md` and `/brain/voice-samples.md` (if they exist) — Narrative voice for the framing and connective prose (customer quotes keep the customer's own voice)

If any required information is missing from the brain, mark it `[VERIFY]` and ask.

## Case Study Framework

Every case study follows this five-section structure. Keep it concise — a full case study should be roughly 600-1000 words, not 1500+.

1. **Headline & Executive Summary** — Compelling headline highlighting the main outcome/transformation, plus a 2-3 sentence summary covering customer, challenge, and result.
2. **Before [Company]** — The situation before: environment, what wasn't working, and business impact. Tell this as a narrative, not a bullet list. Use prose to set the scene and create urgency.
3. **Why They Chose [Company]** — Decision factors and what stood out vs alternatives. A few short paragraphs, not a long list.
4. **After [Company]** — The top results, prioritized by business impact. Combine business and technical outcomes into one unified section — do NOT split into separate "Business Results" / "Technical Results" / "Benefits to Customers" subsections. Lead with the outcomes that matter most to the business, weave in technical details only where they support the story. Use a short list (3-5 items) of the most compelling results, then close with a quote if available.
5. **Call to Action** — "Sign up for a demo" with link to [your-site].

## Case Study Types

**Branded**: Full company name and details disclosed. Use `references/template-branded.md`.

**Anonymous**: Customer identity protected (e.g., "a leading fintech company"). Use `references/template-anonymous.md`.

Ask the user which type if not specified.

## Information Gathering

Before writing, gather these inputs from the user (or interview notes):

### Required
- Customer industry and company size
- Current environment and approach before [Company]
- Gaps, challenges, and business impact from their prior approach
- Why they chose the product and what stood out vs alternatives
- What changed after [Company] (business results, technical results)
- Quantifiable results (metrics, KPIs, time savings)

### Optional but valuable
- At least one customer quote
- Benefits to their end customers
- Team/stakeholder reactions

If information is missing, ask targeted questions to fill gaps. See `references/interview-questions.md` for a complete question guide.

## Writing Guidelines

### Voice and Tone
- Professional but accessible — avoid jargon unless the audience expects it
- Let the customer be the hero; [Company] is the enabler
- Use active voice and concrete details
- Match brand tone from `/brain/positioning-and-messaging.md`

### Write Prose, Not Bullet Lists
Case studies are stories, not spec sheets. Default to well-crafted paragraphs and narrative flow. Use bullets sparingly — only when listing 3-5 discrete results in the "After [Company]" section or when a set of items is genuinely easier to scan as a list. If you find yourself writing more than two bullet sections in a row, stop and rewrite as prose.

**Bad:** A wall of bullets under sub-headers like "Environment," "Gaps," "Business Impact," "Technical Results," "Customer Benefits"
**Good:** A few paragraphs that tell the story naturally, weaving environment, challenges, and impact together

### Brevity
Every sentence should earn its place. Cut filler, remove redundant context, and resist the urge to exhaustively document every detail from the source notes. A case study is a highlight reel, not a transcript. If a detail doesn't strengthen the narrative or prove a result, leave it out.

### Metrics Best Practices
- Lead with the most impressive metric in headline/summary
- Be specific: "reduced MTTR from 4 hours to 45 minutes" beats "faster troubleshooting"
- Weave metrics into the narrative rather than isolating them in a separate table

### Quote Guidelines
- Use direct quotes to add authenticity and emotion
- Include speaker name and title for branded studies
- For anonymous: "The Platform Engineering Lead noted..."
- Place quotes where they reinforce the narrative naturally

## Processing Mixed Inputs

When working with multiple information sources, follow this workflow:

### Step 1: Inventory Sources
List what you have:
- [ ] Interview transcript/recording
- [ ] Written questionnaire responses
- [ ] Internal notes (CSM, sales, support)
- [ ] Usage metrics/data

### Step 2: Extract Key Information
From each source, pull:
- **Before state**: Environment, approach, gaps, challenges, business impact
- **Decision factors**: Why [Company], what stood out vs alternatives
- **After state**: Changes, business results, technical results, customer benefits
- **Metrics**: Specific numbers for the Key Results section
- **Quotes**: Direct customer statements (note source and speaker)

### Step 3: Reconcile Conflicts
If sources disagree:
- Prefer customer direct quotes over internal summaries
- Use most recent data for metrics
- Flag contradictions for user to clarify

### Step 4: Identify Gaps
Check against required information list. Ask user to fill gaps before drafting.

### Step 5: Synthesize Narrative
Combine into single coherent story following the six-section framework.

## Output Formats

**Output location:** `marketing/case-studies/[customer-slug]/` — all files from a single run share this folder. Confirm the customer slug with the user before creating files.

Choose the appropriate format based on the use case:

| Format | Use Case | Template |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Full Case Study** | Website, sales collateral, in-depth sharing | `references/template-branded.md` or `references/template-anonymous.md` |
| **Executive Summary** | Quick 1-pager for prospects, internal briefings | `references/template-executive-summary.md` |
| **Slide Deck** | Sales presentations, webinars, conferences | `references/template-slide-deck.md` |
| **Social Media** | LinkedIn, Twitter, promotional content | `references/template-social-snippets.md` |
| **Web Page** | Website publication with SEO optimization | `references/template-web-page.md` |

## Final Step: Copy-Editing Pass

Before presenting the draft to the user, run a full copy-editing pass using the `copy-editing` skill:

1. **Vale Lint** (Sweep 0): If the draft has been saved to a file, run `vale <filepath>`. Fix all errors, address warnings. If Vale is not installed or the draft isn't saved yet, skip and note "Vale: SKIPPED."
2. **Clarity**: Every sentence immediately understandable. Technical details accessible to the target audience.
3. **Voice**: Consistent tone throughout. Professional but not corporate.
4. **So What**: Every claim answers "why should I care?" Results connect to business impact, not just technical metrics.
5. **Prove It**: Every claim is substantiated — numbers, quotes, or concrete examples. No unearned superlatives.
6. **Specificity**: Vague words replaced with concrete ones. Results include numbers and timeframes.
7. **AI Writing Tics**: Scan for rhetorical negation-pivots, throat-clearing phrases, and repetitive rhythm patterns. One negation-pivot max per piece.
8. **Cross-section phrase repetition**: Scan the full draft for any key phrase appearing more than twice. The headline owns the phrase — vary or cut everywhere else.
9. **Em Dash Check**: Max 5 per case study.

Case studies are long-form and customer-facing — run the full sweep.
